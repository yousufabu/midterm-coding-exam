why do we need data structure?
A.
Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Searching – We can easily search for any data element in a data structure.
Sorting – We can sort the elements either in ascending or descending order.
Insertion – We can insert new data elements in the data structure.
Deletion – We can delete the data elements from the data structure.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Data structures are used in any program or software.
They are used in the areas of.
Compiler Design.
Operating System.
DBMS.
Graphics.
Simulation.
Numerical Analysis.

what is an Array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ArrayList has only object-type data entries and not primitive data types.

what is LinkedList?
A linked list in Java is a dynamic data structure whose size increases as you add the elements and decreases as you remove the elements from the list.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a grouping of data elements of equivalent data type. A linked list is a group of entities called a node. 

what is queue?
Queue in Java is a linear data structure where you can handle an ordered collection of elements. 

what is stack?
A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. 

what is FIFO and LIFO?
LIFO and FIFO are two techniques of maintaining data in a data structure.

what is the order of complexity?
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²).

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Binary Search.Sequential search is the best that we can do when trying to find a value in an unsorted array. 1 But if the array is sorted in increasing order by value, then we can do much better. We use a process called binary search.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.

what is tree in data structure?
A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are generally organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

what is graph in data structure?
 A graph data structure mainly stores connected data

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap is non-syncronized and is not thread safe while HashTable is thread safe and is synchronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
DBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures) Network data model = Graph. Hierarchical data model = Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap stores entries into multiple singly linked lists, called buckets or bins. Default number of bins is 16 and it's always power of 2. HashMap uses hashCode() and equals() methods on keys for get and put operations.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when an array is accessed with an illegal index. 

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
You can use a for loop and copy elements of one to another one by one.
Use the clone method to clone an array.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
BFS or Breadth First Search starts from the top node in the graph and travels down until it reaches the root node. On the other hand, DFS or Depth First Search starts from the top node and follows a path to reaches the end node of the path

What is Recursion?
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In a linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other sequentially. A user can transverse each element through a single run. In a non-linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other hierarchically. Thus, they are present at various levels.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
describes the set of all algorithms that run no worse than a certain speed.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Heap Sort
Insertion Sort	
Selection Sort	
Bubble Sort	

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
